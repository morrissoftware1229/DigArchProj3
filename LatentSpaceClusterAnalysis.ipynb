    "Our group went with the default choice of \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.\" The 1989 movie centers around two sets of siblings who are shrunk by the inventor father's latest invention. One set of children is the inventor's children, Amy and Nick, and the other children are the neighbor's children, Russ and Ron. The children run away from what would be mild dangers for adults but are serious dangers due to their size such as mud puddles and small scorpions. They use whatever they can to give themselves an advantage such a Lego block shelters, ants as transportation, and their dog's amazing hearing ability to finally find and signal to the inventor father who is able to save them."

    "3. Which characters are seen together most often?\n",

    "3. After performing the last step, it appears they are all very close, possibly because the entire movie centers around all four of them, but Nick very narrowly beat other the other children.
